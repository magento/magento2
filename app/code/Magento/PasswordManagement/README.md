The Magento_PasswordManagement module provides an advanced encryption model to protect passwords and other sensitive data.
For customer passwords, the module implements upgrading hashes. For admin passwords, it enables setting lifetimes and locking them when expired or when a specified numbers of failures have occurred. It allows preventing password brute force attacks for system backend.
