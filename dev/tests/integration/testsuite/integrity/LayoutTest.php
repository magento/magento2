     * The "no theme" (false) is prepended to the result -- it means layout updates must be loaded from modules
     *
     * A test that uses such data provider is supposed to gather view resources in provided scope
     * and analyze their integrity. For example, merge and verify all layouts in this scope.
     *
     * Such tests allow to uncover complicated code integrity issues, that may emerge due to view fallback mechanism.
     * For example, a module layout file is overlapped by theme layout, which has mistakes.
     * Such mistakes can be uncovered only when to emulate this particular theme.
     * Also emulating "no theme" mode allows to detect inversed errors: when there is a view file with mistake
     * in a module, but it is overlapped by every single theme by files without mistake. Putting question of code
     * duplication aside, it is even more important to detect such errors, than an error in a single theme.
