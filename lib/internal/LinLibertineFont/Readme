LOFP - Libertine Open Fonts Project

1. OPEN FONTS PROJECT'S AIMS
We work on a serif font-family for practical use in documents. This project aims at creating a free alternative to the standard W*ndows Font (T*mes).
But neveretheless Libertine is not a clone of any common font! It has been developed from scratch and it goes different ways in typography than the Times. Just the useability and the dimensions shall be similar, Libertine should be even better for typical office use! If you want a Times-clone go elsewhere! If you just need reliable and good typography give this font a chance. If you want to know more about the design of Libertine, have a look at our website.

2. LICENSE AND OPENSOURCE
We publish our fonts under the terms of the GPL (see GPL.txt) and OFL (OFL.txt) 
-> see also LICENCE.txt!
The OpenSource-tool Fontforge is used as font editor (see http://fontforge.sf.net).

3. FONT FORMATS TTF VS. OTF
The font files are available as TTF (TrueType) and OTF (OpenType) fonts. The TTF-Family is called "LinuxLibertine" and the OTF "LinuxLibertine O" so that both types can be installed and used parallely.
Most often TTF is the better supported format though OTF has advances in printing. Decide yourself what is better for your purpose. OpenType-features are equally available in both fonts. Note that OpenOffice doesn’t support OTFs, yet.

4. HINTING
The TrueType-hinting is a complex technique and our editor FontForge doesn't support full possibilities (but is alot better version by version)... Since version 2.7 also the normal TTFs are hinted. If you don't like this, send me a mail. You may also try the OpenTypes (which contain PS-Hintings which are quite good supported by fontforge).

5. DOWNLOAD AND CONTACT
We publish our fonts at http://linuxlibertine.sf.net.

6. THE UNDERLINED VARIANT
Please note: The underlined variant is recently not being maintained because 
its concept doesn’t seem to be sofware-technically reliable and because of lack of interest. 
Some people liked our idea of a real underlined. The advantage of this font is that g, commas, cedillas... are not overprinted by the line anymore. For technical reasons the space is not underlined but you can use the _ instead. In this font it has the width of the space and the line is at hight of the underline. The underlined variant uses an older font outline! Please keep this in mind!
