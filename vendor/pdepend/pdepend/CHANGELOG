introduced with PHP 5.4, we are ready to release version 1.0.0 of 
PHP_Depend. PHP_Depend can now handle traits, static closures, binary 
numbers, the callable type hint and the new short array syntax. Beside 
that, we have spent much effort in improving PHP_Depend's overall 
performance and we got an average speed gain of ~ 15% for processing 
major frameworks like Symfony2 or FLOW3, when PHP_Depend's file cache 
(default setup) is used. Additionally this release closes several

  property declaration. Fixed in commit #373c478.

pdepend-0.10.8 (2012/01/24)
===========================

This release closes an issue in PHP_Depend's parser that produces 
invalid package names when the source file contains a statement before 
the class or interface doc comment.

  structure Fixed in commit #b62bed7.

pdepend-0.10.7 (2011/12/06)

  file:... Fixed in commit #5ac3e55.

pdepend-0.10.5 (2011/05/20)
===========================

This release closes two minor bugs in PHP_Depend. One incompatibility

  #8d4a095.

===========================

This release contains an improvement in PHP_Depend's memory 
consumption. We have optimized the internal data structures in such a 
way that the memory footprint was reduced by ~30%. These values were 
measured for currently popular frameworks with a medium to large sized 
code base. The tests were run under ubuntu with PHP 5.2.17 and PHP 
5.3.6.

pdepend-0.10.3 (2011/03/02)
===========================

code that prevents PHP_Depend from running on windows. This release 
was published on March the 02th 2011.

- Fixed #10659085: Analyzer locator code does not work on windows. 
  Fixed in commit #0101798.

pdepend-0.10.2 (2011/02/28)
===========================

This release of PHP_Depend closes two bugs. One related to the start 
and end line properties of object property nodes in the syntax tree. 
The second fix closes a bug in PHP_Depend's implementation of the WMCi 
metric. Beside these two fixes this release implements three minor 
features, one design issue in the syntax tree api and the other two 
other features are related to the new metrics CE, CA, CBO and NPM. 
Additionally we have restructured PHP_Depend's directory structure 
from a custom, freestyle format to a directory layout that is similar 
to maven's convention. With this change we have fixed several issues 
and workarounds in PHP_Depend's build process.

- Fixed #9936901: WMCi calculation is incorrect for overwritten 
  methods. Fixed in commit #69d079a.

  commit #5fb6900.

pdepend-0.10.0 (2011/02/05)
===========================

This version only contains a small bugfix compared to the last release 
canditate. Version 0.10.0 of PHP_Depend was released on February the 
05th 2011. The key feature for this release is the overall performance 
of PHP_Depend. Therefore we have implemented a new caching layer that 
reuses already calculated analyzes-results much more efficient than 
older versions of PHP_Depend. With these modifications we have 
achieved a performance gain of 100% and more for consecutive 
analysis-runs. This final release only fixes a small bug in 
PHP_Depend's analyzer class locator that has caused some issues when 
PHP_Depend was executed as an external dependency that uses a \*.phar 
archive as distribution format.

- Fixed #9623949: Also find analyzers in phar archives in the current 
  include_path. Fixed in commit #f53dca9.
- Fixed #113: PHP fatal error when an unserialized object graph none 
  NodeI instances. Fixed in commit #c0f4384.
- Fixed #164: Faulty implementation of the --ignore path filter fixed. 
  Now this filter only works on the local part of a file or directory 
  name and not on the complete path. Fixed in commit #f75275e.
- Fixed #176: Calculation of CIS metric is incorrect. Fixed in commit 
  #1193f4a.
- Fixed #182: Clone is a valid function, method and type name in older 
  php versions. Fixed with git commit Fixed in commit #b18bf37.
- Fixed #189: Invalid Start/End Line/Column for object method 
  invocation. Fixed in commit #c6cc9dd.

  paths. Fixed in commit #38e6b52.
- Fixed #163: Alternative syntax end tokens can terminate with closing 
  PHP-tag.

  "t3extplorer" (Unexpected token ASCII 39). Indirectly fixed in this 
  release.

  nested ASTCompoundExpression node instance.

  syntax.
