/* 
 * we're going to implement our comment hacks using important comments 
 * and we WON'T have to use the -comments:hacks switch
 *
 * BUT if we do this, we have to be careful not to put text inside the important
 * comment hacks, because text within the important comments get sent to the output.
 * If we use the -comments:hacks switch, we would strip the non-significant text
 * from within the comment hacks.
