24-MB02,Rating,2,"Screwed up my back","I can't believe they're claiming these straps are ""padded."" Wearing this thing to class for a semester totally screwed up my back, and my shoulders would start to ache after a few minutes where the straps dug in.",Orville,

24-MB05,Rating,5,"Great bag! I use it for everything! ","Great bag! I use it for everything! Not sure what happened with the person who said the strap broke because mine is perfect. Maybe it was fluke? I'd return it and try another. It's been awesome for me!",Quinn,
24-MB06,Rating,5,"This bag is really cool","This bag is really cool. I'm an art major, so I have tons of supplies that I have to lug back and forth every day for class.

24-MB06,Rating,2,"Color is weird","I wanted to like this bag, and it is definitely good quality, but the color is so weird in real life. From a distance it kind of looks like I just found it in a dumpster. Shame because that is the only drawback.",Adalberto,
24-MG01,Rating,5,"I am OBSESSED with these","I run 5 times a day and am OBSESSED with this watch! It tracks and calculates all the things my brain can't because I hate maths. PS I know this is a men's watch and I am not a man, but I have large wrists!",Refugio,

MJ03,Rating,4,"avid hiker/snowboarder","I'm an avid hiker/snowboarder and know quality when I see it. Please don't be fooled by the thin feel of this jacket - I always feel very comfortable and only rarely feel too warm, and then it's only because I wear insulating base layers.

MJ04,Rating,5,"Has never let me down","This jacket is going to be by my side for the rest of my life. It's never let me down once in a rainstorm, always keeping me dry as I bike back and forth to work. ",Long,

MJ05,Rating,2,"This jacket feels like sandpaper","This jacket feels like sandpaper next to my skin.  I don't care-let me get wet!",Dave,
MJ06,Rating,5,"I just live for this track jacket","I just live for this track jacket. Because it's solid, I can put it on over any t-shirt and look really athletic. I may not exercise all the time, but wearing this jacket makes other people think I do!",Wyatt,
MJ06,Rating,3,"Not 100% sure how I feel","Not 100% sure how I feel about this yet so I'm going to number it right in the middle. It keeps me warm but the fleece is kind of itchy. It definitely has to go on top of another layer or you'll spend all day itching!",Glen,
MJ06,Rating,4,"fleece lining","The fleece lining is what sold me! I hate being cold and this jacket really helps me not to be. Almost perfect-the hem slightly unraveled which is preventing me from giving it a 5.",Shon,

MJ10,Rating,4,"Great on my evening ride","I went back to the site and snagged another in a different color - they're great on my evening rides. I usually prefer raglan sleeves but I am always comfortable in this design, and the mesh works wonders for keeping my temperature down. ",Arden,
MJ10,Rating,3,"Loop thing broke","I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that the effing  loop thing broke. It wasn't stretchy enough and now im back to carrying my fone and sweating on it ughghg! ",Jessie,
MP01,Rating,2,"They chafed me!","They chafed me!",Rashad,

MS02,Rating,4,"Works for the gym","Works for the gym and even as an undershirt.",Roland,
MS03,Rating,5,"I like the crew neck","I got this shirt in the v-neck version too and I like the crew a lot better. It seems to fit better and I think the fabric is lighter. This one doesn't have the mesh inserts but allover the fabric feels better.",Edison,
MS03,Rating,1,"Hate the fabric","Why is this kind of fabric all the rage? I know it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread with the moisture wicking crap but I feel like I sweat MORE than with just regular cotton. I'm over paying an arm and a leg for the ""technology."" give me a 5 dollar tshirt from the dollar store!",Hai,
MS04,Rating,5,"Ready to hit the gym","As soon as I put this shirt on I feel ready to hit the gym, even on my laziest days. Something about the way it feels just gets me psyched up!",Cletus,
MS04,Rating,2,"Too small ","I'm a bodybuilder with extremely large, buff muscles and this shirt simply does not accommodate my bulk.

MS08,Rating,3,"Comfortable and soft","On the plus side, it's definitely comfortble and soft,  and yes it does keep you dry  no matter how much you sweat.

MS08,Rating,2,"Very comfy but wears thin","It is very comfy but wears thin - I won't be able to get much more use out it as it now is revealing my bra I think. I have the white one so I will switch to a darker color if I decide to by another 1. Very embarrassing when your at the gym. ",Hiram,
MS09,Rating,4,"I've lost 50 pounds in 5 months","I've lost 50 pounds in 5 months and this shirt kept me comfortable since day one. I would recommend it to anyone serious about workout. Sizes run small tho so order a size up. ",Darwin,
